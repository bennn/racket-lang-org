Racket version 6.10.1 is now available from [http://racket-lang.org/](http://racket-lang.org/)

Version 6.10.1 patches the recent v6.10 release in three small ways:

 * On Linux, corrects a mishandling of file-stream ports that can block on input or output (such as pipes between processes), where closing a blocked port may cause a port that's opened later to be incorrectly reported as blocked.

 * On Windows, corrects a crash in the handling of symbolic links.

 * On all platforms, corrects the peer-side results from `tcp-addresses`.
